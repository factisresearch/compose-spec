This project has been forked from https://github.com/inetum-orleans/docker-compose-spec-typescript and heavily altered.

It would be great to generate richer, runtime types, but as of 4/2023 neither `json-schema-to-zod` nor `io-ts-from-json-schema` can handle compose schema. Issues including https://github.com/StefanTerdell/json-schema-to-zod/issues/51, https://github.com/maasglobal/io-ts-from-json-schema/issues/33.
